# Communication Link

Final project for ECE-300: Communication Theory

Team: Ivan Chowdhury, Hanoch Goldfarb

## Project Description
- Designed and simulated a communication link in MATLAB

- Optimized communication link to meet a desired bit error rate (BER).

- Maximized total number bit rate through the channel.

## Instructions

1. Install [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/) with the communications toolbox (check during installation).
2. Clone this repository.
3. Open `CommLink.m` and `CommLinkP2.m` in MATLAB.
4. Run each script and view the graphs for analysis of the communication link's performance.
