# Communication Link

Final project for ECE-300: Communication Theory

Team: Ivan Chowdhury, Hanoch Goldfarb

## Project Description
- Designed and simulated a communication link in MATLAB

- Optimized communication link to meet a desired bit error rate (BER).

- Maximized total number bit rate through the channel.


## Course Description
Information theory: entropy, information, channel capacity, rate-distortion functions, theoretical limits to data transmission and compression. Error control coding: block, cyclic and convolutional codes, Viterbi algorithm. Baseband and bandpass signals, signal constellations, noise and channel models. Analog and digital modulation formats (amplitude, phase and frequency), MAP and ML receivers, ISI and equalization. Coherent and non- coherent detection, carrier recovery and synchronization. Performance: computation of SNR, BER, power and bandwidth requirements. Multiple access schemes. OFDM.
